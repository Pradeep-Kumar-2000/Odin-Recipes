            <p>
                The Egg Masala is one of my favorite dishes. Pair with rice or Chapathi, and you are good to go. 
                It contains numerous spices and is garnished with Coriander. I feel like you could take this for 
                Lunch or Dinner and it would turn out to be delicious.
